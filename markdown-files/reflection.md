I had a lot of fun with this project. I had made a portfolio website in the intro Comp sequence freshman year, so I was familiar with the file organization, uploading to the Linux servers, and HTML in general. I started by making my file hierarchy then worked one page at a time. My general strategy was asking ChatGPT for a template with some basic needs and organization. From there, I kept that code and made all edits myself rather than asking for more a more specific full page, asking questions as they came up.

The most difficult part for me was achieving the design I had in mind using just tables. I couldn't seem to get cellpadding or spacing the way I wanted to. This was especially difficult in the home page's central table. Other than that, it was tedious for me to individually edit font tags for all of the text. I definitely appreciate CSS more now.

Unfortunately I will have two MD files for my ChatGPT conversations as I didn't realize I started a new conversation.
