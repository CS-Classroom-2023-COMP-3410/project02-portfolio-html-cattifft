                    It's been just over a week since I've been back in Denver. I've moved into my first off campus
                    apartment with Josie, and we've got a pretty cute place in the works. I recommend Restore and the Goodwill on
                    Broadway for anyone looking for cheap, quality furniture. We've been pretty busy catching up with people
                    since both of us haven't been in Denver since last June!

                    This morning, Evelyn came over to eat biscuits and grits with us. We owed her a
                    good meal after she fed us delicious dumpling soup last night. Unfortunately, the
                    weekend fun is over, and it's time for us to do our homework. How can I have so much
                    in Week 1?! If anyone has taken Systems II, you should send me a message...

                    So what's with this site? Glad you asked! It's my first website designed using purely
                    HTML. I wanted to reference one of my favorite part of the 90's, N64 era video games. Wait, you're
                    saying Animal Crossing was first released on the GameCube? Well, it actually did release on
                    the Nintendo 64 first, but only in Japan. The more you know!
